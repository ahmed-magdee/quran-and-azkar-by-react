# Quran And Azkar قرآن وأذكار

## The new version is here ^^

Here I changed the design and removed the Tafsir section and relied solely on explaining the verse in the Quran section.
I used Typescript with React

## What is Quran And Azkar?

This is My first project with react, react-router-dom, redux, react-redux, axios, Emailjs and tailwind, This website contains the Noble Qur’an, interpretation of the Qur’an, Hadith, morning and evening remembrances, supplications of the Prophets from the Qur’an, praises, and much more. There is also a personal page where you can obtain guidance on reading the Qur’an and know where you left off.
